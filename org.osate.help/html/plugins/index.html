<H2>OSATE plug-ins</H2>
<p>
OSATE also provide a set of plug-ins, either for validating your models or
interface them with other tools. Users can develop their own 
plug-ins to connect AADL models with other tools. The following sub-sections
present the tools included in the pre-defined set of plugins shipped
with OSATE. Users interested in developing their own plug-ins
would read the plug-in help development.
</p>
<p>
The following plug-ins are currently included with OSATE:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="imv.html">Instance Model Viewer</a></strong> or IMV: provides
   		a graphical view of the Instance Model.
   </li>
   <!-- 
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="arinc653.html">ARINC653 framework</a></strong>: provides tools
   		for validating AADL models compliant with the ARINC653 AADL annex.
   	</li>
   	 -->
   	<li>
   		<strong><a href="sei.html">SEI analysis plug-ins</a></strong>: analyzes 
   		models for given quality criteria (security, safety, performance, etc.).
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		<strong><a href="lute.html">LUTE</a></strong>: provides a high-level language
   		for querying the model and validating requirements without
   		having to write a complete OSATE plug-in.
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		<strong><a href="functional-importer.html">Simulink and SCADE importers</a></strong>: 
   		provides the ability to generate an AADL skeleton model from a functional
